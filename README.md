## Fashion Retail Sales

## Overview
This notebook focuses on analyzing customer satisfaction in a clothing business over a span of 11 months. The goal is to identify factors contributing to customer dissatisfaction and propose actionable strategies to enhance satisfaction ratings. By leveraging descriptive and inferential statistical analyses, the project aims to provide insights into sales performance and customer feedback, ultimately guiding business decisions to improve customer experience.

## Notebook Purpose:
In this notebook, you will:

### Data Collection:
- **Extract sales and customer review data** from the business's databases.
- **Store the data** in a structured format for analysis.

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Clean and preprocess** the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Prepare the data** for analysis by aggregating sales and review information by product and time period.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- **Conduct exploratory analysis** to understand the distribution of sales, payment methods, and customer ratings.
- **Visualize sales performance** across different months and identify top-selling products using Tableau.
- **Analyze customer ratings** to determine average satisfaction levels and identify products with the highest and lowest ratings.

### Inferential Analysis:
- **Perform hypothesis testing** to compare average customer ratings between cash and credit card payment methods.
- **Interpret the results** to determine if there is a significant difference in customer satisfaction based on payment method.

### Conclusion:
- **Summarize the findings** from both descriptive and inferential analyses, highlighting key insights.
- **Provide recommendations** on how to improve customer satisfaction, such as adjusting prices for low-rated products or focusing on other factors beyond payment methods.

### Visualization and Reporting:
- **Use Tableau** to create interactive dashboards that showcase sales trends, product performance, and customer satisfaction metrics.
- **Enable action links** in Tableau to allow users to explore the data and insights interactively.
- **Publish the Tableau dashboard** for easy access and sharing.

## Tools and Libraries:
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly in handling structured data.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Employed for implementing statistical tests and evaluating model performance.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for creating visualizations and plotting the results of the EDA and analysis.
- **Tableau**: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing data trends with action.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for interactive development, documentation, and testing.
